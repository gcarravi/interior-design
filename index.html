                        <p>Some clients don’t need a complete redesign of a room or an entire home. This option lets you
                            tap into two decades of interior design expertise only when you need it. It’s more like a
                            focused consultation than a full-scale design package — a chance to troubleshoot ideas, gain
                            clarity, or validate decisions at any stage of your project or renovation.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            You might simply be looking for guidance with a specific detail. I can assist with refining
                            sample choices, suggesting trusted brands, offering lighting recommendations, reviewing
                            architectural drawings, and much more — whatever support helps move your project forward.

                            2 hour block, time can be used in person, remotely or a combination of both.

                            navigate the many possibilities with confidence. Drawing on more than 20 years of guiding
                            clients in expressing their personality through colour, I appreciate how important the right
                            shades and pairings are in creating a space that feels truly yours.

                                multiple rooms across two homes, guiding my ideas and narrowing endless choices with
                                their excellent taste and eye for colour. They are efficient, organised, and brilliant
